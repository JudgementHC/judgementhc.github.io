							<div class="main-text__subtitle">
								<p>Greet your business contacts with a handshake and a slight bow. Remember to respect the hierarchy that influences Hong Kong business culture. When you are introduced to a group of people, greet the most senior member first. Keep in mind that business can only be successful if you treat your partners with courtesy.</p>
								<p>Make sure to always address people with their title and surname (e.g. Doctor Yeoh). You will soon realize that a plenty of businesspeople in Hong Kong use a Western name to make it easier for their Western contacts to address them correctly. In Hong Kong business culture, physical contact is rare, and interactions are rather formal. Therefore you should try to avoid physical contact beyond the usual handshake.</p></div>

							<div class="main-text__title"><strong>Hong Kong Business Culture: Dress Code</strong></div>
							<div class="main-text__subtitle">
								<p>In Hong Kong, businesspeople dress fairly conservatively, usually in black suits, shirts, and ties. You should try to stick to your formal attire, even during business dinners. Dark, muted colors are usually the best choice for your clothing.</p>
								<p>Remember that, in Hong Kong business culture, colors can have different meanings. Red is considered a lucky color while white is a traditional symbol of mourning. Pay close attention to these meanings when choosing a color scheme for the day. Wearing a red tie, a red blouse, or another red piece of clothing might have a positive effect. If you want to accessorize, a fancy watch or an elegant necklace also help you dress to impress.</p></div>

							<div class="main-text__title"><strong>Hong Kong Business Culture: Meetings</strong></div>
							<div class="main-text__subtitle">
								<p>If you want to arrange a meeting with business contacts in Hong Kong, it is always a good idea to make appointments well in advance. Try to avoid scheduling meetings on Christmas, Easter, or around the Chinese New Year, which are all popular times for vacation in Hong Kong business culture. Don’t forget to call or email your business partners the day before to confirm your appointment.
									During the meeting, greet the most senior business partner first and then work your way down the hierarchy. Hand out your business cards. Here you should make sure, just like with your wardrobe, to stick to a positive or neutral color scheme. One side of your business card should be printed in Chinese, the other one in English.</p>

								<p>In Hong Kong business culture, it’s key to be well-prepared for the meeting and to support everything you present with some facts and figures. It is just as important to be diplomatic in your choice of words, though. </p>

								<p>“Yes” may not necessarily mean “yes”, just “I hear you” or “I understand what you are saying”, and a refusal or disagreement is mostly not phrased as a blunt “no”. Do not say “no” directly, but try to find a different phrasing. Always remain calm, patient, and modest during negotiations. In Hong Kong business culture, negotiations take a while as everything is discussed in detail and considered thoroughly. Don’t pressure your business partners, but give them time to think things through. </p>

								<p>Although English is commonly used in Hong Kong business culture, you should try to be respectful of your Chinese business partners. Speak slowly and clearly, and practice or try to learn Cantonese in Hong Kong if you can. If your Cantonese is not quite up to Hong Kong business culture, you may at least try a bit of small talk or a few polite phrases to show your effort.</p></div>

							<div class="main-text__title"><strong>Hong Kong Business Culture: Gift Giving</strong></div>
							<div class="main-text__subtitle">
								<p>If you present a gift, then be prepared for the fact that, before it is accepted, it will be refused once or twice. This refusal is only a tribute of politeness, so you should not take it seriously.
									If you are invited to someone's home, it is recommended to bring sweets, fruit or flowers as gifts. However, remember that you should not give red or white flowers.
									Also never give scissors, knives and other cutting objects, as they indicate that you want to break off relations. There is no need to present watches, shawls and straw sandals, as they are associated with funeral and death.</p>
								<p>Do not wrap gifts in white, blue or black paper. It is better to choose gold and red, because they are associated with good luck and prosperity, and indeed make beautiful gift wrapping.
									Great attention must be paid to packaging: it must be solid and thoroughly executed.
									If possible, do not give an odd number of any items, because many odd numbers are considered unlucky. Also, in no case do not give four items - this number is associated with death due to the consonance of the words "death" and "four" in Chinese.</p>
								<p>But a particularly favorable number is eight, so to give the recipient eight pieces something means to wish him additional happiness.
									A small gift for children like sweets and fruits is always welcome.
									Always hand your gift with two hands.
									In China and Hong Kong, it is not accepted to open gifts immediately upon receipt.</p></div>

							<div class="main-text__subtitle">
								<p>Tipping in Hong Kong is very important. Attendants expect no less than 10% of the invoice amount, even if the service charge is already included in the order. </p>
								<p>Taxi drivers, as a rule, themselves pay the fare to the nearest amount, and if not, they will appreciate if you give a little more.</p></div>
